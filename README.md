# EchoPlex Graph

EchoPlex Graph is a Python application that builds and visualizes a concept graph based on text input using a large language model (LLM). The nodes in the graph represent key concepts, and the edges represent the relationships between these concepts, with weights based on their significance and frequency.

## Features

Text Analysis with LLM: Analyze text input to extract key concepts and their relationships using OpenAI's LLM.
Graph Construction: Build a concept graph where nodes represent words, and edges represent their connections with weights.
Visualization: Visualize the graph with node sizes and edge widths reflecting their significance.

## Requirements

Python 3.7+
spaCy
NetworkX
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenAI API key
